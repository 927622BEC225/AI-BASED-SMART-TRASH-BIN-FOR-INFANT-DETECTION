This project aims to design a smart dustbin system integrated with AI and IoT that not only monitors waste levels but also detects the presence of an infant inside the bin using a camera and artificial intelligence. The system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect bin fill levels and sends alerts to the municipality via serial/GSM communication. A camera module captures images, and a trained AI model (e.g., using Teachable Machine or TensorFlow) identifies if an infant is present. If detection is confirmed, an emergency alert is triggered, along with sound and visual indicators, ensuring immediate action. This system enhances both waste management efficiency and public safety, addressing the rare but critical issue of infant abandonment.
